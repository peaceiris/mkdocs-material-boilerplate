# Serve and open with invoke



## invoke

> Invoke is a Python (2.7 and 3.4+) library for managing shell-oriented subprocesses and organizing executable Python code into CLI-invokable tasks. It draws inspiration from various sources (make/rake, Fabric 1.x, etc) to arrive at a powerful & clean feature set.
